## Objects

An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.

- state
	- dogs(name, color, breed, hungry)
	- bicycles(current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed)
- behavior
	- dogs(barking, fetching, wagging tail)
	- bicycles(Â (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes)

Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.
